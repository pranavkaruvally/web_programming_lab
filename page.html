        <h2 id="server">Clients/Server concepts</h2>
			<p>
				The client-server model, or client-server architecture, is a distributed application framework dividing tasks between servers and clients, which either reside in the same system or communicate through a computer network or the Internet. The client relies on sending a request to another program in order to access a service made available by a server. The server runs one or more programs that share resources with and distribute work among clients.

The client server relationship communicates in a request–response messaging pattern and must adhere to a common communications protocol, which formally defines the rules, language, and dialog patterns to be used. Client-server communication typically adheres to the TCP/IP protocol suite.

TCP protocol maintains a connection until the client and server have completed the message exchange. TCP protocol determines the best way to distribute application data into packets that networks can deliver, transfers packets to and receives packets from the network, and manages flow control and retransmission of dropped or garbled packets. IP is a connectionless protocol in which each packet traveling through the Internet is an independent unit of data unrelated to any other data units.

Client requests are organized and prioritized in a scheduling system, which helps servers cope in the instance of receiving requests from many distinct clients in a short space of time. The client-server approach enables any general-purpose computer to expand its capabilities by utilizing the shared resources of other hosts. Popular client-server applications include email, the World Wide Web, and network printing.

        <h2 id="webapp">Components of Web Application</h2>
			<p>
				All web-based database applications have three primary components: A web browser (or client), a web application server, and a database server.

Web-based database applications rely on a database server, which provides the data for the application. The database server sometimes also provides business logic in the form of stored procedures. Stored procedures can offer significant performance advantages, especially in a multi-tiered architecture. In addition to database servers, other enterprise information system components include IMS databases, IBM® MQ messages, and CICS® records.

The clients handle the presentation logic, which controls the way in which users interact with the application. In some cases, the client validates user-provided input. Web applications sometimes integrate Java™ applets into the client-side logic to improve the presentation layer.

        <h2 id="types">Types of Web Content</h2>
			<p>
				

Web content development is the process of crafting all the information your website offers. It can involve everything from research and analysis to the creative design, writing, and editing processes, through formatting, organizing, and publishing the resulting content on the site.

In the early days of the web, content development generally meant taking existing documents and coding the text into HTML. But with today’s smart search engines, web content includes virtually anything that can be distributed by an HTTP server and viewed by a web browser.

That means not just the text on webpages and assets such as documents and PDFs, but also videos, audio recordings, images, animation, and other digital elements are now searchable. That opens up almost endless possibilities for ways to engage an audience and create leads through web content.

Examples of effective website content

Expert web content development produces pages that your audience will find helpful, informative, unique, and entertaining. Done right, it encourages visitors to stay longer on a site to explore and learn more or to bookmark pages to return to again later.

In addition, original and high-quality text-based content that is optimized for SEO can help your site rank well in web searches, helping customers and prospects find you.

Here are 7 types of high-quality web content that can please website visitors and keep them coming back for more.
1. Blogs

Blogging is an invaluable tool for driving visitors to your website, and building awareness about you and your brand.

Generally written from a more personal and informal point of view than content assets, a blog is a great way to connect with readers. It is the perfect vehicle for providing them with information that not only answers a question or solves a problem, but also helps to establish you as a trusted authority on the topic.

Blogs are also a great way to keep your web content fresh, enabling you to post new content on a regular basis and helping you continue to rank in SERPs (search results).
2. Content assets

This broad category of web content includes collateral and similar resources you have already invested in and can now repurpose to help draw visitors to your website.

Some examples are product brochures, user manuals, slide presentations, white papers, industry reports, case studies, fact sheets, ebooks, webinars, and podcasts.

The goal is to extend the value of these assets by using them across different digital media and channels. The content can be broken up into smaller pieces and distributed in new ways, such as via blog posts, tweets, video clips, email blasts, search engine ads, and other channels.
3. Calls to action

A call to action (CTA) is a prompt designed to get your website visitor to take some immediate action, such as make a purchase or get more information.

In addition to having CTAs on your web pages, you can include them in other marketing content you use to drive traffic to your website, such as blogs, emails, social media posts, and e-newsletters.

A CTA may take your web visitor to a landing page for further action.

Whatever your CTA is, it is important that the intent is clear and your audience has a good idea what to expect. After all, you don’t want lose visitors by having them click on a link that takes them somewhere they really don’t want to go.
4. Landing pages

Landing pages are destinations — the web pages where visitors are sent when they click on a hyperlink, such as a search engine result, a social media ad, a CTA, or a special offer on your website.

These pages are designed to help you convert website visitors into leads by providing a way to capture their contact information.

For example, suppose you want to build your authority as an SME by offering a free white paper to your website visitors. When they click on the offer link, it can take them to a landing page where the content of white paper is described in more detail and they can download the paper by submitting an email address.
5. Testimonials

One of the best ways to appeal to prospects and build credibility is with relatable success stories from their peers. That is what makes customer testimonials such valuable web content.

Whether your goal is to create formal case studies, include real-life customer scenarios in a white paper, or post short video clips on Twitter or Facebook, having a process in place to identify happy customers and capture their feedback is a great idea.

TIP: Don’t hide all your valuable customer feedback on one testimonials page. Include testimonials throughout your site to serve as social proof that validates your claims.
6. Video & audio content

With the ability to embed video and audio clips so that anyone can view and listen without leaving the webpage, digitally recorded media are increasingly popular web content tools. It is a great way to offer content such as how-tos, webinars, podcasts, and seminars.
7. Visual content

According to the Social Science Research Network, 65% of people are visual learners. So, it makes good sense to incorporate visual web content into your website.

In addition to having a graphic design that helps to convey the flavor and purpose of your brand, you can:

    Use images — preferably original ones — to break up and enhance the text
    Create videos to entertain and inform
    Reiterate key information in a concise way through infographics
    Create your own memes to make important messages more memorable
    Offer presentations for visitors who want details in a more graphic, bulleted format
    Include screenshots to clearly show things that may be difficult to explain in words

Where do you begin to do web content development?

It’s a double-edged sword: There are virtually unlimited possibilities for creating web content — but that makes it a pretty daunting task, especially when you are not in the business of marketing or don’t have the resources to dedicate to full-time web development.

Thinking about existing content and ways you might repurpose assets you have already made an investment in is a great place to start.

But for truly engaging web content development, it is also important to have two things:

    Deep insights about your buyers (from buyer persona research)
    A strategy for creating purposeful content that gives visitors a reason to keep coming back to your website.

For professional support in creating your website and/or keeping it fresh, content development services offer expertise in everything you might need:

    Buyer persona and other helpful research
    Content strategy
    Graphic design
    Web content writing
    Technical writing
    SEO
    Social media
    Video and multimedia development

A web content development professional can help you create high-quality content that both expresses the uniqueness of your business and provides website visitors with an experience that is easy to use, informative, and inviting.

        <h2 id="httpoverview">Overview of HTTP - HTTP request - responst</h2>
			<p>
				The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. This is the foundation for data communication for the World Wide Web (i.e. internet) since 1990. HTTP is a generic and stateless protocol which can be used for other purposes as well using extensions of its request methods, error codes, and headers.

Basically, HTTP is a TCP/IP based communication protocol, that is used to deliver data (HTML files, image files, query results, etc.) on the World Wide Web. The default port is TCP 80, but other ports can be used as well. It provides a standardized way for computers to communicate with each other. HTTP specification specifies how clients' request data will be constructed and sent to the server, and how the servers respond to these requests.
			</p>
        <h2 id="generation">Generation of dynamic web pages</h2>
			<p>
				A server-side dynamic web page is a web page whose construction is controlled by an application server processing server-side scripts. In server-side scripting, parameters determine how the assembly of every new web page proceeds, including the setting up of more client-side processing.

A client-side dynamic web page processes the web page using JavaScript running in the browser as it loads. JavaScript can interact with the page via Document Object Model, or DOM, to query page state and modify it. Even though a web page can be dynamic on the client-side, it can still be hosted on a static hosting service such as GitHub Pages or Amazon S3 as long as there isn't any server-side code included.

A dynamic web page is then reloaded by the user or by a computer program to change some variable content. The updating information could come from the server, or from changes made to that page's DOM. This may or may not truncate the browsing history or create a saved version to go back to, but a dynamic web page update using AJAX technologies will neither create a page to go back to, nor truncate the web browsing history forward of the displayed page. Using AJAX, the end user gets one dynamic page managed as a single page in the web browser while the actual web content rendered on that page can vary. The AJAX engine sits only on the browser requesting parts of its DOM, the DOM, for its client, from an application server. A particular application server could offer a standardized REST style interface to offer services to the web application.[1]

DHTML is the umbrella term for technologies and methods used to create web pages that are not static web pages, though it has fallen out of common use since the popularization of AJAX, a term which is now itself rarely used. Client-side-scripting, server-side scripting, or a combination of these make for the dynamic web experience in a browser.

        <h2 id="appservers">Application Servers</h2>
			<p>
				An application server is a modern form of platform middleware. It is system software that resides between the operating system (OS) on one side, the external resources (such as a database management system [DBMS], communications and Internet services) on another side and the users’ applications on the third side. The function of the application server is to act as host (or container) for the user’s business logic while facilitating access to and performance of the business application. The application server must perform despite the variable and competing traffic of client requests, hardware and software failures, the distributed nature of the larger-scale applications, and potential heterogeneity of data and processing resources required to fulfill the business requirements of the applications.

A high-end online-transaction-processing-style application server delivers business applications with guaranteed levels of performance, availability and integrity. An application server also supports multiple application design patterns, according to the nature of the business application and the practices in the particular industry for which the application has been designed. It typically supports multiple programming languages and deployment platforms, although most have a particular affinity to one or two of these. Some application servers that implement standard application interfaces and protocols, such as Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE), are entirely proprietary. At present, the proprietary application servers are typically built into OSs, packaged applications, such as portals and e-commerce solutions, or other products and are not offered as stand-alone products. Proprietary and Java EE-compliant application servers are estimated in our Market Share and Forecast reports.

As the application server market matures, high performance becomes a stronger criterion, and thus where vendors now incorporate extensions to application servers, such as extreme transaction processing and event-based processing capabilities, these are also included in this market segment.

        <h2 id="websecurity">Web Security</h2>
			<p>
				

Web security refers to protecting networks and computer systems from damage to or the theft of software, hardware, or data. It includes protecting computer systems from misdirecting or disrupting the services they are designed to provide.

Web security is synonymous with cybersecurity and also covers website security, which involves protecting websites from attacks. It includes cloud security and web application security, which defend cloud services and web-based applications, respectively. Protection of a virtual private network (VPN) also falls under the web security umbrella.

Web security is crucial to the smooth operation of any business that uses computers. If a website is hacked or hackers are able to manipulate your systems or software, your website—and even your entire network—can be brought down, halting business operations.
Factors That Go Into Web Security and Web Protection

To comply with internal policies, government-imposed criteria, or Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) standards, security professionals consider a variety of factors. Keeping abreast with OWASP standards helps security staff stay up to date with industry-standard web safety expectations.

In addition, encryption must be kept up to date, the latest threats in the Web Hacking Incident Database (WHID) monitored, and user authentications properly managed. When vulnerabilities emerge, security personnel must install the most recent patches to address them. To secure data, software development teams have to implement protocols that shield code from being stolen during or after writing it.
